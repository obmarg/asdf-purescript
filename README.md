# asdf-purescript

[PureScript](http://purescript.org/) plugin for
[asdf](https://github.com/HashNuke/asdf) version manager.

This is an incredibly simple plugin that leverages npm & asdf itself for most
of the hard work.

## Install

```
asdf plugin-add purescript https://github.com/obmarg/asdf-purescript.git
```

## Use

Check [asdf](https://github.com/HashNuke/asdf) readme for instructions on how
to install & manage versions of PureScript.

Installing PureScript requires npm - you can use
[asdf-nodejs](https://github.com/HashNuke/asdf-nodejs) to install this if you
don't have it already.  Note that you need `.tool-versions` file with nodejs in it
in your home directory for the install to work.
